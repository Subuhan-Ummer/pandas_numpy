   Create a NumPy array with numbers from 1 to 10 and reshape it to a 2x5 matrix.

2. **Element Extraction**  
   Create a NumPy array with numbers from 1 to 20 and extract elements between indices 5 and 15.

3. **Pandas Series Manipulation**  
   Create a Pandas series with initial data and add a new key-value pair.

4. **DataFrame Creation**  
   Create a DataFrame with `name`, `age`, and `gender` columns containing 10 rows of data.

5. **Adding a Column**  
   Add an `occupation` column to the DataFrame with predefined values.

6. **Row Filtering**
